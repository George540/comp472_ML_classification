8. Redo steps 6, 10 times for each model and append the average accuracy, average macro-average F1,
average weighted-average F1 as well as the standard deviation for the accuracy, the standard deviation
of the macro-average F1, and the standard deviation of the weighted-average F1 at the end of the file
drugs-performance.txt. Does the same model give you the same performance every time? Explain in a
plain text file called drugs-discussion.txt. A 1 or 2 paragraph discussion is expected.

The purpose of this task is to experiment with a set of data using different machine learning
models. Six different models were used of types Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Perceptrons.
Based on the default parameters of train_test_split(), it is expected to get different results
for every run. Since the instructions specified only step 6, the same dataset was used for all
10 runs of the models. It is believed that the professor made an unintended error, where all
steps from task 2 were supposed to be included in the runs. Therefore, by running again the
entire script from the main.py menu will give different results all the time, since there is a different
randomization of the dataset using train_test_split() with shuffle=true (by default).
