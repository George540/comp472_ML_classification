(a) what metric is best suited to this dataset/task and why
With text classification, we argue that it is more important to
prioritize a higher precision accuracy. We can compare
this task (task 1) with that of spam filtering in an email.
Where we would like the algorithm to NOT classify a file incorrectly
and then classify it in the wrong label/folder. In the 4 reports that
we have, the accuracy increased as the smoothing value was changed
to 0.9. Along with the F1 score, weighted and macro. In order
to achieve the higher preceision importance, we would have to change
beta in the F score to < 1.

(b) why the performance of steps (8-10) are the same or are different than those of step (7) above
